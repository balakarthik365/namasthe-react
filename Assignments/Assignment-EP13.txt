● What are different types for testing?
There are 3 types of testing
unit testing - Testing the react component in isolation. which means test cases written for one component.
Integration testing - Testing the integration of components. like writing the testcases to check the component communication using props and states.
e2e testing - Done by the QA team. this will be the manual and automation testing.

● What is Enzyme?
Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output. 
It was developed by Airbnb and was the industry standard for several years before React Testing Library (RTL) became the dominant choice.

● Enzyme vs React Testing Library
Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output. 
RTL focuses on what the user experiences.
getByRole(), getByText() – These encourage accessible coding because they force you to think about how a screen reader or a user finds elements

● What is Jest and why do we use it? 
Jest is the delightful js testing framework. React testing library uses jest in background while testing.
We have to install and configure the jest before using it using  npx create-jest and also the parcel library for the same.
