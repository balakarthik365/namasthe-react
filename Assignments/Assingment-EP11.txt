Concept	Key Takeaway
Prop Drilling - Passing data through components that don't need it.
Lifting State - Moving state to a parent to sync two or more children.
Provider - The component that "broadcasts" the data.
Consumer/useContext - The mechanism used to "tune in" to that broadcast.
Default Value - Only used if the component is not wrapped in a Provider.
