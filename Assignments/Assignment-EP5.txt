● What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and * as export?
A named export is given before the variable when created.
Ex: export const CDN_URL="";
A default export is added at last with default and file name.
Ex: const TEXT = () =>{
}
export default TEXT;
* as export refers to using wild card to select all files

● What is the importance of config.js file
A config.js file is a crucial component in software development used to store configuration settings and parameters in a central location, separate from the main application code. 
This separation enhances maintainability, security, and flexibility across different environments

● What are React Hooks?
Hooks in React are normal JS functions. Written by Facebook developer.
To use them we have to import the Hooks. The most important hooks in React are useState and useEffect.
useState - Helps to create a state variable. This will keep the UI intact with the Data layer.
When ever state variable updates, React re-render the component.

core concepts: state management, side effects, reusability, simplicity

useState: Lets you add a state variable to your component and provides a function to update it.
useEffect: Performs side effects after a component renders and can include a cleanup function to prevent memory leaks.
useContext: Allows a component to subscribe to and read a context value from a parent provider, simplifying data sharing across the component tree.
useReducer: A more advanced alternative to useState for managing complex state logic, often when the next state depends on the previous one.
useRef: Returns a mutable ref object that persists across re-renders without causing a component update. It's useful for accessing DOM elements or storing mutable values.
useMemo: Caches the result of an expensive calculation and only re-computes it when its dependencies change, optimizing performance.
useCallback: Memoizes a callback function definition, preventing unnecessary re-creation of functions on every render, which is particularly useful for optimizing child components. 

● Why do we need a useState Hook?
Helps to create a state variable. This will keep the UI intact with the Data layer.
When ever state variable updates, React re-render the component.
