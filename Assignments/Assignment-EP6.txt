● What is a Microservice?
A Microservice is an architectural style where an application is broken into small, independent services, 
each responsible for a single business capability and communicating via APIs.
These services includes of BE, UI, Auth, DB, SMS, E-mail
This is known as seperations of concerns and a single responsibility application.
React application can be treated as UI micro service.

● What is Monolith architecture?
A Monolithic architecture is where the entire application is built as one single unit (UI, business logic, and database). 
are tightly coupled and run as one large process, making it simple to develop and deploy initially but challenging to 
scale, update, or maintain as it grows complex, often contrasting with microservices. 
It's like one big block of code, where changing one small part requires recompiling and redeploying the entire application, leading to potential single points of failure. 

● What is the difference between Monolith and Microservice?
----------------------------------------------------
|Feature   	    | Monolith	 | Microservice         |
----------------------------------------------------
|Deployment     | Single     | Independent          |
|Scalability	| Entire app | Per service          |
|Tech stack	    | One	     | Multiple allowed     |
|Failure impact | Whole app	 | Isolated             |
|Best for	    | Small apps | Large enterprise apps|

● Why do we need a useEffect Hook?
useEffect is used to handle side effects in React functional components.
useEffect is a normal JS function and it has two arguments.
  1. A callback function and
  2. A dependency array
This is called after the component renders.

Side effects include:
 - API calls
 - Subscriptions
 - Timers
 - DOM updates
Example:
useEffect(() => {
  fetchHotels();
}, []);

● What is Optional Chaining?
Optional chaining safely accesses nested object properties without causing runtime errors.
user?.address?.city
✔ Prevents Cannot read property of undefined
✔ Improves readability

● What is Shimmer UI?
Shimmer UI is a loading placeholder UI shown while data is being fetched.
✔ Improves perceived performance
✔ Better UX than loaders/spinners
Example:
{isLoading ? <Shimmer /> : <RestaurantList />}

● What is the difference between JS expression and JS statement
Difference between JS Expression and JS Statement
🔹 Expression
Produces a value
Can be used inside JSX
2 + 2
isLoggedIn && <Dashboard />

🔹 Statement
Performs an action
Cannot be used directly inside JSX
if (x > 5) { ... }
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { ... }
📌 JSX allows expressions, not statements.

● What is Conditional Rendering, explain with a code example
Conditional Rendering means rendering UI based on a condition.
{isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Login />}
    
● What is CORS?
CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing
A CORS is a mechanism which uses additional HTTP headers to tell the browser. whether, a specific web app can share a resource from other web app.
Both web apps should have different origin.
How resource sharing between two applications works?
Before any call from one application to other application is made. There a preflight option is checked and adds additional HTTPS headers along with the headers.
Additional http headers - [Access-control-allow-origin/methods:*]
No, all calls need not be go with preflight call.
To resolve the error we can set the header from the server. We have browser plugins.

● What is async and await?
async and await are used for a function to handle the asynchronous operations in synchronous style
a function name added with async key before it and await is used inside the async function.
This functions are clear then promises and use try and catch to handle the API calls.
An async function returns a promise.

● What is the use of `const json = await data.json();` in getRestaurants()
✔ fetch() returns a Response object
✔ .json() converts response body into JavaScript object
✔ await waits until parsing completes
