● useContext vs Redux.
Both will resolve the prop drilling scenarios. 

useContext is prebuilt feature in React
    steps to create useContext
    1. create a context using createContext
    2. use the context using the useContext
    3. use UseContext.Provide to access the value across all components by setting the value attribute. if no value is passed it will be undefined.

Redux is external library which handle the predictable state management
    steps to create Redux
    1. Install redux using npm i @reduxjs/toolkit and npm i react-redux
       The hooks that are used for redux comes from the react-redux package and to create slice and configure the store these comes from @reduxjs/toolkit packages
    2. Create a slice
    3. Create a store and configure the slice
    4. Provide the store in app.js or main.js 
    5. Now when we use the slice in other components this will dispatch and action and calls the reducer function.
       This reducer function will update the store and we can subscribe to the store to use the values in the store.

● Advantage of using Redux Toolkit over Redux.
    1. Easy boiler plate code
    2. Ease of creating slices and managing the state
    3. we can mutate the state directly or return an empty object. In traditional redux we have to mutate the state manually
    4. gives prebuilt slices and configure stores to automate store setup

● Explain Dispatcher.
Dispatcher will call the action. so that a reducer function will update the store.

● Explain Reducer.
Reducer is a middle ware which takes multiple reducers from the slice after configuring the store.

● Explain slice.
Slice is create so that it can be added to the store and the reducers actions can be used to update the initial state value.
it will have three major components,
1. name
2. initialState
3. reducers
Note: export the actions and reducer so that the slice is configured and used in other components.

● Explain selector.
selector is used to get the state value that can be used across the application.

● Explain createSlice and the configuration it takes.
createSlice is used to create the slice for the RTK integration in the react application.
it will have three major components,
1. name
2. initialState
3. reducers
Note: export the actions and reducer so that the slice is configured and used in other components.
Ex - 
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: "cart",
  initialState: {
    items: [],
  },
  reducers: {
    addItem: (state, action) => {
      state.items.push(action.payload);
    },
    removeItem: (state,action) => {
      const index = action.payload;
      state.items.splice(index,1);
    },
    clearCart: (state) => {
      state.items.length = 0;
    },
  },
});

export const { addItem, removeItem, clearCart } = cartSlice.actions;
export default cartSlice.reducer;

Now, after creating the slice configure it to the store as below
Ex - 
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import cartReducer from "./cartSlice";
const appStore = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    cart: cartReducer,
  },
});

export default appStore;
