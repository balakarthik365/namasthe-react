● Is JSX mandatory for React?
Yes, because it gives you the flexability to write HTML like and JSX code to gether. 
Any how the function component that you build and return the JSX code is the object that is again rendered to HTML using renders.
It is not mandatory to used JSX we can use React.createElement to create elements. but , it is heptic to handle
So, when we have feasablity to use JSX we have to use it. but need to follow some instructions.

● Is ES6 mandatory for React?
Yes, because we use Map, filer, reduces and arrow functions with Let and Const variables and many other features of ES6 in react.

● {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
{TitleComponent} - returns the JS object
<TitleComponent/> - returns and renders the JSX object
<TitleComponent></TitleComponent> - Similar to <TitleComponent/> but we can pass child components. basically renders component with childrent content.

● How can I write comments in JSX?
using /***comments****/

● What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></> ?
Both are fragments that used to group the multiple lines of JSX elements into single fragment.
So there is no extra DOM wrapper needed to write elements
The major difference is React.Fragment allows you the key propert while <></> have no keys.

● What is Virtual DOM?
A Virtual DOM is a lite weight lightweight JavaScript representation and it is similar DOM to Actual DOM that is maintained by REACT. So all the changes are marked on Virtual DOM.
Later, reconcelliation is done where diffing algorithm made to check the changes from Virtual DOM to Actual Dom and then Actual DOM gets updated.

● What is Reconciliation in React?
Reconciliation is a technique that differentiates the Virtual and Actual DOM and then reflects the changes to Actual DOM using diffing algorithm

● What is React Fiber?
React Fiber is React’s internal reconciliation engine introduced in React 16 that enables incremental rendering, prioritization, and interruptible updates.
It allows React to:
Pause and resume rendering
Prioritize urgent updates (like user input)
Improve responsiveness for large applications

● Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?
Keys help React uniquely identify elements in a list so it can efficiently update, add, or remove items during reconciliation.

● Can we use index as keys in React?
Using array index as a key is discouraged when the list is dynamic (add/remove/reorder).
Why index keys are bad
Causes incorrect UI updates
Breaks component state
Poor performance

● What is props in React? Ways to
Props (properties) are read-only inputs passed from parent to child components to configure and reuse components.
Ways to pass props
1️⃣ Basic props
<Header title="Dashboard" />
2️⃣ Children props
<Card>
  <p>Content</p>
</Card>
3️⃣ Destructuring props
function Header({ title }) {
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
}
4️⃣ Callback props
<Button onClick={handleClick} />
5️⃣ Spread props
<Component {...props} />

● What is a Config Driven UI ?
A Config-Driven UI is a design approach where the UI structure and behavior are controlled by configuration data (JSON or API response) instead of hardcoded logic.
