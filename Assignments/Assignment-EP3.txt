● Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
type="module" used to tell the React application that the JS script what we added in index.html file is not the browser script.
The type attribute defines how the browser should treat the script.
type="module" tells the browser that the script is an ES Module, allowing the use of import and export, enabling strict mode and deferred loading.

● {TitleComponent} vs - This is a react element. created as an element which is generally a JS variable.
{<TitleComponent/>} vs - This is a react component. created as a function which is a generally a JS function. This will render the JSX component.
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX - This will also render the JSX component.

{TitleComponent} → Just a JS function reference

<TitleComponent /> → Renders the component

<TitleComponent></TitleComponent> → Same output, used when passing children
